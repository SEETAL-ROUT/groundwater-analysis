# Groundwater Quality Analysis using SQL and Power BI

This project analyzes groundwater quality data of Telangana (2020) using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for dynamic data visualization and reporting.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Classify groundwater suitability for agriculture and consumption based on key metrics like SAR, pH, EC, and TDS.
- **Dataset:** Telangana groundwater sample data (2020)
- **Approach:** Used SQL queries for data filtering and aggregation. Power BI dashboards were used to visualize water quality zones and identify risk areas.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Regions with high Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) identified.
- Classification of water suitability for agriculture.
- Visualization of pH level variations across different districts.
- Drill-through and filter-enabled dashboards.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Microsoft Power BI
- MySQL
- SQL Queries
- Excel for preprocessing

## 📈 Output Visuals

- Average water quality metric cards
- Heatmaps for region-wise EC, SAR, and pH levels
- Interactive filters for district and year
